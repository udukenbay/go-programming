#1: Go emphasizes ease of programming. If you use the short declaration operator, you do not need to specify the type.

#2: How do computers work? (choose the most correct answer)
Computers run on electricity. Electricity has two discrete states: on and off. We can use "coding schemes" to store messages 
associated with different states of on and off. "On" can represent one thing, and "off" can represent sth else. We can then create
billions of circuits which can be in "on" or "off" states to represent all kinds of things including sound, images, videos, text, and more.

#3: In relation to computers, what do zeros & ones represent? (choose the best answer)
States of circuit. 1 is on, and 0 is off.

#4: A boolean value is one that is either true or false
true

#5: If you have 5 porch lights, how many messages can you encode?
32 (2 >> 5)

#6: The computer power symbol is cleverly a ZERO and a ONE. This is pretty neat as ZERO represents OFF 
    and ONE represents ON, which is exactly what a power symbol allows you to do - turn something ON and OFF.
true

#7: "Bit" is an abbreviation of "binary digit"
true

#8: ON & OFF, 1 & 0, Binary Digits, Bits, and Machine Language are all words used to refer to this idea that, 
    within a computer, it's all nothing but a bunch of ZERO's and ONE's, or switches that are ON or OFF, 
    it's all just a bunch of Binary Digits, or Bits, that's the language which computers speak, it's machine language.
true

#9: circuits, switches, transistors, and even "gates" are all words used to refer to this thing within a computer 
    that can either be ON or OFF. It's a circuit, it's a switch, it's a gate that can either be OPENED or CLOSED, 
    it's a transistor - you will learn that people use all of those words to talk about this same thing, 
    this ability of computers to store ON / OFF states.

#10: The world's most popular text coding scheme today is
UTF-8

#11: 1000 bytes = 1KB

#12: 1000 GB = 1TB

#13: Consult this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count and then choose the number of transistors 
    (aka circuits, switches, "lightbulbs" in my porch analogy) which can be found on processors today. 
    Choose the answer below which is CLOSEST to what is presented on the wikipedia page.
50+ billion

#14: How many circuits  (aka transistors, switches, "lightbulbs" in my porch analogy) did the Eniac computer have?
16,000

#15: rune is an alias for int32
true

#16: byte is an alias for uint8
true

#17: If you use type int, then the compiler will choose whether int32 or int64 is used. 
    Another way to say this is that int has implementation-specific sizes.

#18: As a rule of thumb, for numeric types, you should just use "int" for whole numbers (without decimals) 
    and "float64" for real numbers (with decimals)
true

#19: A string is a sequence of bytes.
true

#20: Go source code is always UTF-8.
true

#21: A string is a sequence of bytes that represent Unicode code points, called runes.
true

#22: What is a coding scheme?
a "coding scheme" is a way to have circuits in on/off positions represent sth else, like letters in the alphabet for instance.

#23: What is the number 42 in decimal?
42

#24: What is the number 42 in binary?
101010

#25: What is the number 42 in hex?
2A
